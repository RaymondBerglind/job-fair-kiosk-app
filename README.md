# Simple Kiosk Style Web App

## About
This is a small app with a client and a server that was built for a job fair that I was attending for work. It was used to host a guess-the-number-of-candies-in-the-jar competition. Visitors would enter their information and guess in the frontend client, which would then be sent to the server to be saved locally. The server would also send a custom email to participants, thanking them and giving them more info about our company.

## Built with React and Node.JS
>Why go through the trouble of building such a small app with both React and Node instead of just using regular Javascript to do everything in the client and calling it a day?"

Simple, I just wanted an excuse to learn a little bit of both of these tools and went with it. Check it out if you're interested!
